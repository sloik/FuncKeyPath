# FuncKeyPath

Operator for creating functions out of KePath.

## Why?

Sometimes I want to use KePath as a function but it's not possible. 

Well, not it is ðŸ¤“

# How to use... 

Just prepend `^` before the keypath and you are set ðŸ˜Ž

```swift
...
.map( ^\URL.sheme ) // now keypath is a function
...
```
